<h1>About me (One Page Bio)</h1>

<p>My name is Raphael Mahe Desportes and I am a 3rd year student at Sogang University <br>
Business School. I was born in 1997 in Longjumeau ,a medium sized city next to Paris.<br>
My parents are still living there, and I have not been able to see them for <br>
a long time because of the COVID19.<br>

 I chose South Korea for my studies.My first contact with South Korea was in Summer 2015 where I did<br>
 a trip to Seoul, Busan and Daegu.I was then studying Asian Civilization and languages in order to work with the<br>
 french police to help asian tourists in Paris. I decided to stop my studies to study korean<br>
 language in a private institute in Seoul (Lexis Korea) but I did not have the best<br> 
experience there. Then I spent almost one year in SKKU’s language institute<br>
 in order to learn korean. It was this time a great experience and my korean skills<br> 
went up as I passed the TOPIK. Back in France , I went to the Korean Embassy<br>
 and applied for a working holiday VISA that I earned.<br>

 I worked 5 months in Itaewon nightclub House Ming but I was not satisfied with this <br>
work. I quitted and was recruited as a waiter and wine advisor in Hyewa’s Moonshine. I <br>
was recommended by a friend that I met in a language exchange program. After 1 year <br>
of work there , I was offered a working VISA that I refused in order to study at Sogang University.<br>
 I have a lot of interest in online business , insurance and management. I am now still focused on having <br>
good grades and i am still working on my korean skills because some classes are still very difficult because<br>
 of the language. My main goal is to find a job in Korea in management or in luxury brands, <br>
especially because I like french and italian top brands.<br>

Aside from university , I am really interested in Formula One racing,<br>
cosmology and physics. I am living in Sindaebang , and I like the online <br>
classes since i can rewatch the classes at the pace i want , which i think is really<br>
 convenient for foreigners abroad.<br>

<h1>About Ebay.com</h1>
<p>
<img src="C:/Users/rmday/Pictures/ebay2.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"/> <br>

I chose the website <a>ebay.com</a> for my analysis.
 Ebay is a C2C (consumer to consumer) and a B2C 
(business to customer) multinational e-commerce
 platform. There is also an app for this website.<br>
 
IOS <a><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/buy-sell-and-save-with-ebay/id282614216" target="_blank">Download here</a></a> <br>
ANDROID <a><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ebay.mobile" target="_blank">Download here</a> </a> <br>

Ebay is using Javascript front end and Java ,javascript and scala in back-end.Javascript
enables interactive web pages and is widely used alongside HTML and CSS.It can be 
considered as a precursor of e-commerce website since it has be founded in 1995 under the name
AuctionWeb“”Ebay has the particularity to be an online auction based website. The seller set a
starting price and people can bid on it. The buyer with the higher bid at the end of the time
limit is able to buy the object.  You can also sell directly an object without bid with the 
“immediate purchase” feature.Ebay offers the possibility to search for an item. It is usually 
used for second hand items but there are more and more brand new products. You
have a mailbox to discuss with buyers and sellers ,you can add items to your favorite in order to know
if the time limit for an auction is soon .There is alsoa recommended item list,  thanks to big data and deeplearning.
 Ebay is widely used in the west , even if it is less popular 
than before, especially because of more local websites (leboncoin in France, Vinted
in western europe, Karrot in Korea...)<br>
	
	Ebay is a very good website when you want to sell something old or rare and you are not sure about his 
value. Since this is a bid website , prices can go really high for rare or old objects. This is the best online place
to sell art , collectibles , old money , old games etc…. Bidding is also something fun and thanks to Ebay.com, is
something accessible for all social classes. This is a convenient place to sell worldwide and shipment costs are calculated
automatically. Ebay is an easy way to get new customers and it’s really easy and convenient to sell an item. However
there are plenty of sellers on the platform which means a lot of competition. There is also a high rate of returns and fees.
